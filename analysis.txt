Data Exploration and Correlation Analysis – Wine Dataset

In this analysis, the Wine dataset from sklearn was used. The dataset contains
chemical properties of different wine samples.

Several features were explored, including alcohol, malic_acid, ash, and flavanoids.
Histograms showed that alcohol values are relatively normally distributed, while
some other features are slightly skewed.

A scatter plot and correlation plot were created between alcohol and flavanoids.
The correlation scatter plot shows a clear positive relationship between these two
variables. As the alcohol content increases, the flavanoids level also tends to increase.

The regression line confirms a strong positive correlation, indicating that alcohol
is a good predictor of flavanoids content in this dataset.
